# Bagels, a logic game
## You are given a three-digit number and you have to guess it. You have 10 attempts to do this
## Hints. What do these definitions mean:
###  Pico: One digit is correct but in the wrong position.
### Fermi: One digit is correct and in the right position.
### Bagels: No digit is correct.
### Otherwise: a message will appear that will notify you that you guessed
# Good luck!
